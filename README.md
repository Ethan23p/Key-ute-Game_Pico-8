# Key-ute_Game_Pico-8

Simple game made for the Pico-8 virtual console. Made as a gift for my life partner, Cass, for valentine's day.
Idea 100% taken from Nicky Case, code 100% written by me, Ethan Porter.

Exhaustively coded with clear comments, readable variable names,
and as-elegant-as-I-can-get-as-of-the-beginning-of-2024 logic.
Mostly as a learning experience & for shareability, partially as a practice in good coding.
Well aware this is not optimal for the Pico-8's limited memory. :shrug:
